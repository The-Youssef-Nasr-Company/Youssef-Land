## <!--2.1--> The Story of _Markdown_

As _[Markdown][Daring Fireball Projects: Markdown]_ was created by [John Gruber], it was time for us to use [it](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).

### <!--2.1.1--> The blockquotes from _[Markdown]_ made by [John Gruber]


> _The overriding design goal for Markdown_'_s_
> _formatting syntax is to make it as readable_
> _as possible_. _The idea is that a_
> _Markdown-formatted document should be_
> _publishable as-is_, _as plain text_, _without_
> _looking like it's been marked up with tags_
> _or formatting instructions_.

## <!--2.5--> Windows Bugs

Windows had a bug on the taskbar text & icons, and no Blue Screen came. I think that was good though.

# <!--3.--> Warning

If you get too much errors onscreen in all of a sudden you'll get a Blue Screen (sometimes you get a sudden hanging 8-bit beep) which warns you sometimes that Windows has been shut down to prevent damage from your computer.

## <!--3.1--> Help is on the way!

You can use <kbd>Escape</kbd> after letting the computer show you the message `Press the ESC key for Startup Menu`, go to `Settings`, then use <kbd>F8</kbd> for Safe Mode to get the bluescreening out of Windows' way.
