#### <!--2.2.2.1--> Minecraft Bugs

There were __uncool__ bugs on Minecraft that must be reported, but where to find the _dashboard_?

## <!--2.4--> Windows Bugs

Windows had a bug on the taskbar text & icons, and no Blue Screen came. I think that was good though.

# <!--3.--> Warning

If you get too much errors onscreen in all of a sudden you'll get a Blue Screen (sometimes you get a sudden hanging 8-bit beep) which warns you sometimes that Windows has been shut down to prevent damage from your computer.

## <!--3.1--> Help is on the way!

You can use <kbd>Escape</kbd> after letting the computer show you the message `Press Esc to go to Startup Settings`, go to `Settings`, then use <kbd>F8</kbd> for Safe Mode to get the bluescreening out of Windows' way.
