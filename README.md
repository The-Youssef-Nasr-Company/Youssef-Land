Here's a code example from BASIC:

```
10 PRINT "WELCOME TO YOUSSEF LAND! AS YOU HAVE CHOSEN THIS BASIC CODE EXAMPLE, LET US GET STARTED!"
20 END
```
Then type `LIST` in any type of system that supports BASIC to check the code example from us.
Type `RUN` to run the BASIC code example.

### <!--1.2.2--> Minecraft Fun Facts

This `README.md` includes fun facts about Minecraft with cheats turned on!

For example, type `/give <username:random> command_block 64` on Minecraft Chat to get 64 Command Blocks as typed in the valid syntax with the permission of an __Operator__! These Command Blocks can get you to experimenting!

You can use `/weather <weather:thunder:clear:rain>` to change the weather as typed in the valid syntax with any type of permission! Using `/tp <who to where>` can transport you to your friend as typed in the valid syntax with any type of permission!

#### <!--1.2.2.1--> Minecraft Bugs

There were __uncool__ bugs on Minecraft that must be reported, but where to find the _dashboard_?

##### <!--1.2.2.1.1--> Jira can help!

To think, [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) can help! To get to the Minecraft bug reporting dashboard, type `bugs.mojang.com` while in `New Tab`.

# <!--2--> Warning

If you get too much errors on screen you'll get a Blue Screen that warns you that Windows has been shut down to prevent damage from your computer. You can use <kbd>Escape</kbd> after letting the computer show you the message `Press Esc to go to Startup Settings`, go to `Settings`, then use <kbd>F8</kbd> for Safe Mode to get the blue screening out of Windows' way.
