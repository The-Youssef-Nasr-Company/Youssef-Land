# Youssef Land Security Policy (introducing GitHub's security policy)

GitHub's [Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com) rewards researchers for discovering security vulnerabilities in a number of repositories. The full list of projects that are eligible for rewards are [available on their Bug Bounty site](https://bounty.github.com/#scope).

If the repository is eligible for rewards, you can submit a report via [HackerOne by GitHub](https://hackerone.com/github). You can find more useful information in GitHub's [rules](https://bounty.github.com/#rules) and [FAQ](https://bounty.github.com/#faqs). In Youssef Land [there's also a FAQ](https://github.com/The-Youssef-Nasr-Company/Youssef-Land/blob/master/README.markdown#-youssef-land-faq) __BUT only [on the README](https://github.com/The-Youssef-Nasr-Company/Youssef-Land/blob/master/README.markdown)__.

For repositories not covered by the Bug Bounty program, please open an issue.

If there's bugs out there on Youssef Land or features are missing in Youssef Land, contact [our organiser](mailto:yoyo.monem22@gmail.com) or submit a issue without the vulnerability removal issue template.
